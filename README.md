# Strange-Assistant

A strange assistant that is both smart, weird and fun to play around with when your bored.

To use this you must install everything in requirements.txt.

Once you have done that go to the terminal/cmd and do cd StrangeAssistant or cd Desktop/StrangeAssistant if the file is on your desktop.

After that do python app.py

Last but not least have fun!
